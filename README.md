# SQL Join Practice â€“ Customers & Orders

The goal of this task is to understand and demonstrate SQL JOIN operations using two related tables: `Custom` (Customers) and `Orders`.

## ðŸ—‚ Tables Overview

### âœ… Custom (Customers)

|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| CustomerID  | INT (PK)    | Unique ID for each customer |
| Name        | VARCHAR(50) | Customer name             |
| City        | VARCHAR(50) | Customer's city           |

### âœ… Orders
